# Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan

## Testing Process
The testing process will be completed in three steps:

- **First**, the gameplay loop must successfully be completed in editor build.  
  - This includes launching the level, completing the level, and returning to the main menu.
- **Second**, no open bug reports in editor build.
- **Then**, play testing will be completed by QA team members in editor build.
- If no game-breaking bugs are found, the game will be packaged for demo shipping.
- QA team members will collaboratively play test, specifically testing each checklist item to ensure functionality.

---

## Schedule: Play Test
The play test will be completed internally, identifying that the core gameplay features are working as intended and the gameplay loop is engaging.

---

## Schedule: Demo Test
The demo test will ensure that a packaged build is ready for launch, ensuring gameplay features are functional and the gameplay loop can be completed.

---

## Schedule: Code Release
Code release schedule will be the end of **Week 4 (30 Mar 25)** and will include a playable build that is ready for more rigorous testing by players outside of the development team.

---

## Checklist

### Play Test
- Character movement

### Demo Test
- Launch level from main menu.
- Checkpoint respawn on death.
- Return to main menu on level complete.
- Return to main menu on game over.

---

## Test Plan Updates
The QA team lead will revise and expand the test plan after each development phase to reflect newly added features, recently fixed issues, and unresolved bugs. Each update will include clearly defined test cases along with target completion dates to ensure timely and thorough quality assurance throughout the development cycle.

---

## Reporting Bugs
Bugs will be reported using **Hack-n-plan** by QA team members.  
During Alpha phase, the team will have a dedicated bug reporting solution available to players participating that they can submit bug reports to.

---

## Tracking Bugs
- Bugs will be tracked in **Hack-n-plan**.
- All bugs reported in Alpha phase by players will be validated by a QA member and added to the bug tracker in Hack-n-plan if repeatable.
- All bugs will be tracked and categorized to show similar occurrences in case not originally repeatable.

---

## Engagement and Collaboration
Team meetings to finalize the test build, play test, and then package the demo.  
A team meeting will be scheduled to test the demo build prior to Alpha release.

## TeamRED 4-2 Project Log: Team Reflection and Alpha Release
The testing process went well with many bugs identified and reported using methods the team intended to use internally. Once reported, the team was able to replicate and resolve the bugs in a timely manner. Using multiple methods to test and retest the bugs ensured a desirable outcome.

Bugs were identified by developers during the testing process by playing and testing specific mechanics. Bugs were categorized based on which development area they were in, which were then resolved via extensive research, where multiple people would go throughout the project and problem-solve the different bugs, going between each area that were categorized, based on most problematic to least problematic for the development process.

As an example, some of the coding ended up not working out, which the coder/lead designer would have to go in and correct to fix and ensure the character would work properly based on the level. Or how some of the level would make the player character go off the level, which would be on the level designer to ensure that doesn‚Äôt happen.

We could have improved the testing process by developing a more specific checklist for mechanics to be tested. For example, instead of testing ‚Äúcharacter movement,‚Äù we could list out elements of the character movement system to be tested. Having a clear goal would have improved the approach our QA testers took and increased the feedback provided.

Our team utilized GitHub Desktop and Hack-n-plan which both came in very helpful and contributed to our success. A common roadblock for many teams and this course in general has been using Git and source control, but using the visual aspects of GitHub Desktop has helped our team stay organized and on track without any major issues.

Using Hack-n-plan, we have been able to assign and report progress very easily, with visibility from each team member being accessible. This has helped to identify specific tasks, improving session efficiency and ensuring scope management.

We have used Discord as the primary form of communication and have been able to maintain contact.
Our game is a 2.5D sidescroller and many of the Unreal Engine 5 provided templates that we planned to use were not helpful. In fact, we scrapped many of them to create our own custom blueprints with functionality that met our intentions.

Our approach using tools and techniques outlined in the game design document was greatly affected by how we as a team would work together to develop the project. As a team geographically separated, we needed a way to communicate while actively working on the project, and GitHub and Hack-n-plan made that possible.

The chosen game type also affected our decision to use specific game assets and design techniques that encouraged our workflow. Each of our inputs are critical to the outcome of level design, functionality, and the game environment, which forced us to work closely and modularly.
