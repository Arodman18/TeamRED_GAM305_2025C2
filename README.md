# Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan

## Testing Process
The testing process will be completed in three steps:

- **First**, the gameplay loop must successfully be completed in editor build.  
  - This includes launching the level, completing the level, and returning to the main menu.
- **Second**, no open bug reports in editor build.
- **Then**, play testing will be completed by QA team members in editor build.
- If no game-breaking bugs are found, the game will be packaged for demo shipping.
- QA team members will collaboratively play test, specifically testing each checklist item to ensure functionality.

---

## Schedule: Play Test
The play test will be completed internally, identifying that the core gameplay features are working as intended and the gameplay loop is engaging.

---

## Schedule: Demo Test
The demo test will ensure that a packaged build is ready for launch, ensuring gameplay features are functional and the gameplay loop can be completed.

---

## Schedule: Code Release
Code release schedule will be the end of **Week 4 (30 Mar 25)** and will include a playable build that is ready for more rigorous testing by players outside of the development team.

---

## Checklist

### Play Test
- Character movement

### Demo Test
- Launch level from main menu.
- Checkpoint respawn on death.
- Return to main menu on level complete.
- Return to main menu on game over.

---

## Test Plan Updates
The QA team lead will revise and expand the test plan after each development phase to reflect newly added features, recently fixed issues, and unresolved bugs. Each update will include clearly defined test cases along with target completion dates to ensure timely and thorough quality assurance throughout the development cycle.

---

## Reporting Bugs
Bugs will be reported using **Hack-n-plan** by QA team members.  
During Alpha phase, the team will have a dedicated bug reporting solution available to players participating that they can submit bug reports to.

---

## Tracking Bugs
- Bugs will be tracked in **Hack-n-plan**.
- All bugs reported in Alpha phase by players will be validated by a QA member and added to the bug tracker in Hack-n-plan if repeatable.
- All bugs will be tracked and categorized to show similar occurrences in case not originally repeatable.

---

## Engagement and Collaboration
Team meetings to finalize the test build, play test, and then package the demo.  
A team meeting will be scheduled to test the demo build prior to Alpha release.
